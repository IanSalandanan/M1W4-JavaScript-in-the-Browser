            // Answer: HTTP request are request made when you want to connect to a specific server, as for HTTP response,
            // when the server receives an HTTP request, it will process the request and send an HTTP response.

            // 1. GET - Retrieves data from the specified resource.

            // 4. TRACE - Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

            // Checkpoint 4.2 What is the difference between callbacks, then-catch vs await-try-catch? When should you use one over the other
            // Answer: All of them are used for asynchronus programming. Callbacks are basically a function that is passed as an argument to another function,
            // it is to be executed later. Callbacks are the traditional way of handling async calls however they pose issues like pyramid of doom.
            // then-catch were introduced to patch the error of callback's pyramid of doom, then-catch allows chaining async operations and uses catch for any possible errors. Used to avoid the issue of callbacks.
            // Await-try-catch is the newest addition to java, await is used to pause the execution until the promises were resolved. Paired with try-catch statements to resolve errors.
